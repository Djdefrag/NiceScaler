 - Installation.

    NiceScaler does not require any installation, it's a single portable exe usable on any Windows PC

 - Supported IA backends.

    Actually NiceScaler utilize only CPU to upscale to be compatible with any PC, even without powerfull GPU

 - Features.

    Different IA models selection
    
    Drag and drop single image or multiple images (batch upscaling) 
    
    Upscaling x2 
    
    Simple and clean GUI
    
    Compatible with PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TIF images
    
    Portable everywhere without installation

 - Next steps.

    Video upscaling

    More AI backends (CUDA / OpenCL / Vulkan)

    Pre-processing (image/videos downscaling before upscaling)

- Feedback.

    Please, give me feedback about the product, i will listen all feedback.


Thank you for your support :)
