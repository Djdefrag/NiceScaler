 - Installation.

    NiceScaler does not require any installation, it's a single portable exe usable on any Windows PC

 - Supported IA backends.

    Actually NiceScaler utilize only CPU to upscale to be compatible with any PC, even without powerful GPU

 - Features.

    Images and video upscaling

    Different IA models selection
    
    Drag and drop single image or multiple images (batch upscaling) 
    
    Upscaling x2 & x4
    
    Simple and clean GUI
    
    Compatible with PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TIF images && MP4, WEBM, GIF, MKV, FLV, AVI, MOV videos
    
    Portable everywhere without installation

 - Next steps.

    More AI backends (CUDA / OpenCL / Vulkan)

    Pre-processing (image/videos downscaling before upscaling)

- Feedback.

    Please, give me feedback about the product, i will listen all feedback.


Thank you for your support :)
