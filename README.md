Installation.
NiceScaler does not require any installation, it's a single portable exe usable on any Windows PC

Supported IA backends.
Actually NiceScaler utilize only CPU to upscale to be compatible with any PC, even without powerfull GPU

Features.
Different IA models selection
Drag and drop image 
Upscaling x2 one image at a time 
Simple and clean GUI
Compatible with PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TIF images
Portable everywhere without installation

Next steps.
If the project is well followed, I will update and implement all the following features:

Batch upscaling (load multiple images)
Video upscaling
More AI backends (CUDA / OpenCL / Vulkan)
GUI-related funcionalities  (Button to stop upscaling, etc.)
Pre-processing (image/videos downscaling before upscaling)
Feedback.
Please, give me feedback about the product, i will listen all feedback.

Thank you for your support :)
